 x = successfully ran "make check" and regression tests
 X = same as 'x' but denotes that this is the default system compiler

SystemC 2.3.2 or later is required for GCC 6.* or later releases.
An installation of UVM-SystemC on other, related platforms and not explictly
tested compiler combinations may be possible. Please note that while the
library still builds with non-C++11 compilers no further effort is spend to
avoid C++11 constructs.


Sources for Compilers and Related Tools
=======================================

To build, install, and use UVM-SystemC on UNIX platforms, you need
the following tools:

  1. GNU C++ compiler, version 4.8.5 (other versions may work as well as documented
     above) or Clang compiler, version 3.7.0

  2. GNU Make (gmake)

  3. Accellera Systems Initiative SystemC reference implementation
     version 2.3.0a or later (formerly known as OSCI reference implementation)

GCC, Clang, and gmake are free software that you can
obtain from the following sources:

  GCC           http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html

  Clang         http://clang.llvm.org/

  gmake         http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html

The SystemC reference implementations are available under Apache License
Version 2.0 and can be obtained from the following location:

  SystemC 2.3.0a or later   http://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc

Note: Various EDA vendors natively support SystemC. Please consult your EDA vendors
      to make use of the build-in SystemC capabilities of their simulation
      framework.


Basic UVM-SystemC Installation
==============================

To install UVM-SystemC on a Linux system, do the following steps:

  1. Change to the top level directory

  2. Create a temporary directory, e.g.,

        > mkdir objdir

  3. Change to the temporary directory, e.g.,

        > cd objdir

  4. Set the following environment variable(s):

     For gcc compilers on Linux:

        > setenv CXX g++

     You can also specify an absolute path to the compiler of your choice.

  5. Configure the package for your system, e.g.,
     (The configure script is explained below.)

        > ../configure

     While the 'configure' script is running, which takes a few moments,
     it prints messages to inform you of the features it is checking.
     It also detects the platform.

     As UVM-SystemC relies on the availability of a SystemC installation
     directory, the configure script will automatically check this. In case
     the configure script cannot find SystemC, it will stop. You can specify
     the path to the SystemC installation directory as follows:

        > ../configure --with-systemc=/path/to/your/systemc

     Note for System V users:
     If you are using `csh' on an older version of System V, you might
     need to use the `sh ../configure' command instead of '../configure'.
     Otherwise, `csh' will attempt to `configure' itself.

     In case you want to install the package in another place than the
     top level directory, configure the package e.g. as
     follows:

        > ../configure --prefix=/usr/local/uvm-systemc

     Note: make sure you have created the target directory before installing
           the package. Do _not_ use /usr/local as a prefix.

     See the section on the general usage of the configure script and
     "../configure --help" for more information.

     Note: if you change the configuration after having compiled the
           package already, you should run a "gmake clean" before
           recompiling.

  6. Compile the package.

        > gmake

     Note: The explicit gmake targets "opt" and "debug", etc. have
           been removed in this package.  Use the corresponding
           options to the configure script instead.

  7. Install the package.

        > gmake install

  8. At this point you may wish to verify the installation by
     testing the example suite.

        > gmake check

     this will compile and run the examples in the subdirectory
     examples.

  9. You can now remove the temporary directory, .e.g,

        > cd ..
        > rm -rf objdir

     Alternatively, you can keep the temporary directory to allow
     you to:

     a) Experiment with the examples.

     b) Later uninstall the package. To clean up the temporary
        directory, enter:

            > gmake clean

        To uninstall the package, enter:

            > gmake uninstall


Running the Examples
====================

The UVM-SystemC examples reside in the directory 'examples', within
the temporary directory which was used for the installation
(e.g. objdir).

Use the makefiles provided in the 'examples' directory as templates
for makefiles you need for compiling your own examples. In order to
run these example, the environment variable SYSTEMC_HOME should be
set beforehand. The examples can be executed by using 'make check'.


Using the Configure Script
==========================

The `configure' shell script tries to determine the correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses
these values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It also creates one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions if needed. Then, it creates the following files:

  config.status         A shell script that you can run at another time to
                        recreate the current configuration.

  config.cache          A file in which the configure test results are
                        saved to speed up reconfiguration.

                        Data is appended to the config.cache file.
                        You can remove unwanted data.

  config.log            A file in which compiler output is saved.
                        This is used to debug the configure script.

If you need to use other commands to successfully compile the package
on your system, please try to determine if the configure script can be used
for these commands. Then, send either a diff file or instructions about
the commands you used to the email address provided in the README file.
This information will be used to improve the installation process in
the next release.

The `configure.in' file is provided in case you want to change or regenerate
the `configure' script, for example to use a newer version of `autoconf'.
The `configure.in' file is used by the `autoconf' program to create the
`configure' script.

Note for developers:

  In case you have changed the `configure.in' file or one of the
  `Makefile.am' files:

  - Use the `config/distclean' script to remove the generated `configure'
    script, the generated `aclocal.m4' file and the generated `Makefile.in'
    files.

  - Use the `config/bootstrap' script to generate the `configure' script
    and the necessary `Makefile.in' files. This script makes use of the
    GNU auto-tools `aclocal', `automake', and `autoconf'.


Compilation and Linking Options
===============================

Some systems require compilation or linking options that the `configure'
script does not define. You can define the initial values for these
options by setting them in your environment before running the
`configure' script.

Using a Bourne-compatible shell, the command line entry might be:

        > CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ../configure

Or, on systems that have the `env' program, the command line entry might be:

        > env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ../configure


Specifying the System Type
==========================

Some features cannot be automatically determined by `configure' unless
it can detect the host type on which the package will run.
If it prints a message that it cannot determine the host type,
use the `--host=TYPE' option to define it. TYPE can either be a
short system name, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the `config.sub' file for details about the values of each field. If
the `config.sub' file is not included in the package, the package does not
need to know the host type.

If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system for which
the code is produced and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.


Sharing Defaults
================

You can set the default values that `configure' scripts share by
creating a site shell script called `config.site'. This file contains the
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
The `configure' script looks for the `config.site' file in the following
search precedence:

  1. PREFIX/share/config.site

  2. PREFIX/etc/config.site

Alternatively, you can set the `CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the
site script path.

Note: The `configure' script for some systems does not look for a site script.


Operation Controls
==================

The `configure' script recognizes the following options to control its
operation:

`--cache-file=FILE'
        Use and save the test results in FILE instead of
        `./config.cache'. Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching
        when debugging `configure'.

`--help'
        Print a summary of `configure' options and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
        Do not print messages about checks being made.
        To suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null'.
        Error messages continue to print.

`--srcdir=DIR'
        Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.
        Typically `configure' determines the directory automatically.

`--version'
        Print the version of `autoconf' used to generate the `configure'
        script and exit.

Other options that are rarely used are available in the `configure' script.
Use the `--help' option to print a list.
